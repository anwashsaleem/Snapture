# Snapture v0.2.0

In this version, I replaced the basic local OCR with AI-based captioning using the OpenRouter API. Now it can handle blurry or text-less screenshots better than traditional OCR and also automatically generates short, meaningful titles and concise descriptions.


But this has limitations like:

- Requires an OpenRouter API key (sign up at openrouter.ai).
- API usage limits may restrict the number of processed images.
- No screenshot categorization, UI, or tagging features yet.


How to use it:

1. Place screenshots in the Screenshots folder.
2. Add your OpenRouter API key, model ID, and API URL in the script.
3. Run the script, which will create .txt files with AI-generated titles and descriptions in the TXTs folder.


This version is good for smarter screenshot captioning but need more to be "Snapture".
